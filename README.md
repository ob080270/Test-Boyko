# Test Boyko Excel Project

## Description
This project implements a diagnostic method for assessing burnout, developed by V. V. Boyko. The Excel file contains a form and a VBA program that automate the process of the questionnaire and result analysis, helping to determine the degree of burnout in individuals.

## About the Boyko Method
The Boyko method is intended for diagnosing the syndrome of burnout caused by prolonged stress exposure. The questionnaire consists of 84 statements, to which the respondent answers "yes" or "no." The method allows identifying three main phases of burnout:
- **Tension**: Characterized by experiencing traumatic situations and feeling "trapped."
- **Resistance**: Manifests as selective emotional response and reduction in professional duties.
- **Exhaustion**: Includes emotional and personal deficiency as well as psychosomatic disorders.

In each phase, the main symptoms of burnout are measured, and their intensity is calculated.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Users are prompted to answer 84 questions using a form in Excel.
- **Automated Calculation**: The VBA program processes the answers and calculates scores for each symptom and phase of burnout.
- **Results Interpretation**: The final scores help determine the stage of burnout and highlight the dominant symptoms that require attention.

## How to Use
1. Open the file `TestBoyko.xls` in Microsoft Excel.
2. Ensure that macros are enabled, as the project uses VBA to process data.
3. Follow the instructions on the form, answering each question with "yes" or "no."
4. After completing the questionnaire, the program will automatically calculate and display the results.

## Requirements
- Microsoft Excel with macro support (VBA).
- No prior experience with Excel forms is required as the interface is user-friendly.

## Notes
The Boyko method is useful for identifying burnout levels and is recommended for professionals working in high-stress environments with frequent human interaction.
